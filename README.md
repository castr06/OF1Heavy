This is a custom OpenFrame1 case with a backplate, made with a built in thru-hole plate for the mx switches, to allow for making the box in only two pieces. This was made with CNC milling in mind. <br>
*images are renders dont mind the jagged lines*

# PCB/Board
This design is made for the [OpenFrame1 Board](https://github.com/GregTurbo/Open-Frame1) made by GregTurbo.

# Switches and Caps
Designed for standard/special profile Cherry MX style switches.<br>
For caps you can use any caps made to fit the Frame1 but an ideal open source solution is [NoCap](https://github.com/JonnyHaystack/NoCap) by JohnnyHaystack.

# Hardware
PCB Holes use M2.5 screws, backplate holes use M4 screws. <br>
All holes in this build are made to fit 10mm screws if desired, I recommend the hardware below. <br>
x5 of these style screws for the PCB: [M2.5 5mm Flanged Button Head Screws](https://www.mcmaster.com/92095A457/)<br>
x6 of these style screws for a flush backplate fit: [M4 10mm Ultra-Low Profile Socket Head Screw](https://www.mcmaster.com/product/90358A006)<br>
If made in metal you will need to tap the holes, Most machinists can do this easily, just provide them the info on whichever screws you plan to use, and make sure those screws are no wider than 5mm and no deeper than 10mm from the beginning of the threading. Youll Ideally want a flange for them but for the backplate you can use unflanged screws as to not create any bumps

If made in plastic there is a chance you could just screw those screws in directly, but i would consider adding Heatset Inserts.<br>
If making a box out of plastic I would also highly consider checking out [this project](https://www.printables.com/model/394573-openframe1-full-case) by Davy.
It is much better suited to FDM printing and would use much less material.
