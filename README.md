This is a custom OpenFrame1 case with a backplate, made with a built in thru-hole plate for the mx switches, to allow for making the box in only two pieces. This was made with CNC milling in mind. <br>

# PCB/Board
This design is made for the [OpenFrame1 Board](https://github.com/GregTurbo/Open-Frame1) made by *GregTurbo*.

# Switches and Caps
Designed for standard/special profile Cherry MX style switches.<br>
For caps you can use any caps made to fit the Frame1 but an ideal open source solution is [NoCap](https://github.com/JonnyHaystack/NoCap) by *JohnnyHaystack*.

# Hardware
PCB Holes use M2.5 screws, backplate holes use M4 screws, and all holes in this build are made to fit 10mm screws if desired.<br>
<br>
**I recommend the hardware below:** <br>
*x5* of these style screws for the PCB: [M2.5 5mm Button Head Screw](https://www.mcmaster.com/92095A457/)<br>
*x6* of these style screws for a flush backplate fit: [M4 10mm Ultra-Low Profile Socket Head Screw](https://www.mcmaster.com/product/90358A006)<br>
<br>
If made in metal you will need to tap the holes, Most machinists can do this easily, just provide them the info on whichever screws you plan to use, and make sure those screws are the correct sizes (M2.5 and M4) and no deeper than 10mm from the beginning of the threading. <br>
If the screws you use for the backplate are not ultra-low profile or the head is taller than 1.3mm you **WILL NOT** have a flush fit with the case.<br>
As a note , the smaller holes that sit deeper in the case are the PCB screwholes and the ones that sit up higher and are slightly larger are the ones for the backplate.<br>
<br>
If made in plastic there is a chance you could just screw those screws in directly, but i would consider adding Heatset Inserts.<br>
If making a box out of plastic I would also highly consider checking out this [Full OpenFrame1](https://www.printables.com/model/394573-openframe1-full-case) if you have a larger printer or this [Glue OpenFrame1](https://www.printables.com/model/394572-openframe1-case-glued) if you have a smaller printer, both are made by *Davy*.<br>
Another great project is the [Rana Digital](https://github.com/rana-sylvatica/rana-digital) or the [OFOF1](https://github.com/rana-sylvatica/OFOF1) both by *Rana*.<br>
They are all much better suited to FDM printing and would use much less material.<br>
